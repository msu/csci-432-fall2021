# Miscellaneous Assignment 

Choose your own adventure!  Each of these assignments is worth up to 10 points.
The total (capped at 100) is counted as a homework grade.  The first three
assignments can be completed at any time BEFORE the last week of classes, but
the other miscellaneous assignments have a specific due date.

Some assignments will have specific requirements.  However, for most events, use
the following guidelines:

Throughout this semester, you will have the opportunity to attend various
seminars or events, and write a brief reflection on them for extra credit.
These reflections should be written as a formal two-page paper.  You may
consider the following questions when writing your reflection, but there are no
specific formatting requirements:

* What did you learn?
* Were there any algorithms involved? (Even if not explicitly discussed).
* What is a piece of advice that you took away?
* Did an audience member ask a question that you particularly liked or disliked?
* Is there a question that you wish you could have asked but didn't?
* If related to the event, what were you thinking about as you were leaving?
* Did this event inspire you to look something up after the event? If so, what
  was it?
* Did you meet someone new at this event who you could see as a mentor / mentee
  / collaborator in the future?
* What is your take-away message from this event?


The assignments:

   join cs-announce the notification of who is speaking each week (and the WebEx
   link).  Due: before the last week of class.

3. The course website might have typos.  If you see one, fix it and issue a pull
   request (PR). [More about
   PRs](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request) Due:
   before the last week of class.
4. Attend and reflect on the math seminar by Dr. Karen Uhlenbeck.  Monday, 30
   August 2021. Wilson Hall 1-143. Title is “Transverse Measures and Best
   Lipschitz and Least Gradient Maps”. Abstract:  This work is motivated by a
   preprint of Bill Thurston’s from 1994, which is still a preprint but still in
   circulation.  In it he outlines an approach to  Teichmuller Space based on
   maps between hyperbolic surfaces which minimize the maximum norm of
   directional derivatives of a map, or the Lipschitz constant.  As a warm-up to
   studying this theory from the analysis point of view, George Daskalopoulos
   and I studied the problem of finding functions from a hyperbolic surface M
   into a circle S^1 which minimize the maximum of the derivative among all
   Lipschitz maps in a homotopy class.  These are extensively discussed in the
   analysis literature as infinity harmonic maps. The relevance of least
   gradient functions and transverse measures came as a surprise.  In this talk,
   I will try to explain some of the concepts, which were in fact very new to
   us, and outline the main results.  One of the main theorems  is that the
   maximum stretch set (set on which the function takes on the maximum of the
   derivative) is a geodesic lamination.  (Standard two-page write-up. See
   above).
5. Attend and reflect on the Kopriva Lecture by Dr. Dominique Zosso. Thursday,
   16 September 2021 at 15:00 in the Procrastinator Theater (note: there might be
