# CSCI 432: Advanced Algorithm Topics, Fall 2021 #

This repository is for class materials for CSCI 432 in Fall 2021, taught by Prof. Fasy.

MSU Course Catalog Description: 
A rigorous examination of advanced
algorithms and data structures. Topics include average case analysis,
probabilistic algorithms, advanced graph problems and theory, distributed and
parallel programming.

From the Instructor: This course is NOT a programming class, and is not
structured like the 132 and 232 courses that precede it.  In this course, we will
do many proofs (especially using induction), and will be writing pseudo-code, not
code.

Prerequisites:
CSCI 246 (Discrete) and CSCI 232 (Data Structures and
Algorithms) are a prerequisite for this course.  
In particular, a student enrolled in CSCI 432
should be familiar with 
sorting and searching algorithms, big-Oh notation, 
basic recurrence relations,
heaps, queues, lists, hash tables,
proof by induction and by contradiction, and discrete probability.


## Land Acknowledgement

Living in Montana, we are on the ancestral lands of American Indians, including
the 12 tribal nations that call Montana home today: A’aninin (Gros Ventre),
Amskapi/Piikani (Blackfeet), Annishinabe (Chippewa/Ojibway), Annishinabe/Métis
(Little Shell Chippewa), Apsáalooke (Crow), Ktunaxa/Ksanka (Kootenai), Lakota,
Dakota (Sioux), Nakoda (Assiniboine), Ne-i-yah-wahk (Plains Cree), Qíispé (Pend
d’Oreille), Seliš (Salish), and Tsétsêhéstâhese/So’taahe (Northern Cheyenne).
We honor and respect these tribal nations as we live, work, learn, and play in
this state.

To learn more about Montana Indians, I suggest starting with the following
pamphlet:

## Course Outcomes and Objectives

This course introduces students to the analysis and design of computer
algorithms. In this course, students will:

* Analyze asymptotic time and space complexity of algorithms.
* Describe algorithmic design paradigms (including dynamic programming,
  greedy algorithms, divide and conquer) and explain when an algorithmic design
  situation calls for it.
* Apply methods of analysis (prove
  correctness, time/space complexity, termination) to new
  problems.
* Use and analyze major graph algorithms and data structures.
* Analyze algorithms from recent research publications.

## Accessing this Repo

The repository is set as public, so you can access all course materials easily.
I suggest creating a fork, so that you can use your fork to maintain your own
materials for this class.  See the resources section below for forking directions.

To clone this repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/msu/csci-432-fall2021
```

## Grading
Your grade for this class will be determined by:

- 35% Homework (individual and group)
- 30% Project 
- 35% Exams

* Homework: All assignments must be submitted by 23:59 on the due date. Late
  assignments will not be accepted.  The lowest two homework grades will be
  dropped.  The submission should be typeset in LaTex, and submitted as a PDF
  both in D2L and Gradescope. Each problem should be started on a fresh page.
* The [miscellaneous assignments](misc.md) will be worth up to 10 points each,
  and the total sum will count as a HW grade (max grade: 100).
* Project: Groups will be assigned.  You will be creating a video presentation
  of a "modern" algorithm.  More details to come.
* Exams: We will have three exams in this course. Each exam will be 10% of the
  grade, with the best exam counting an additional 5%.

## Class Policies

### Policy on Class Attendance

Class attendance and participation is required and expected. If you consistently
miss class, then your final grade may be dropped one letter grade (e.g., from B+
to C+).

### Policy on Collaboration
Collaboration is encouraged on all aspects of the class, except where explicitly 
forbidden. Note:

- All collaboration (who and what) must be clearly indicated in writing on
  anything turned in.  
- Homework may be solved collaboratively except as explicitly forbidden, but
  solutions must be written up **independently**.  This is best done by writing
  your solutions when not in a group setting.  Groups should be small enough
  that each member plays a significant role.

### Classroom Etiquette

Except for note taking and group work requiring a computer, please keep
electronic devices off during class, as they can be distractions to other
students. Disruptions to the class will result in being asked to leave the
lecture, and one half-point will be deducted from your final course grade.

### Withdrawing

After 25 October 2020, I will only support requests to withdraw from this course
with a "W" grade if extraordinary personal circumstances exist.  If you are
considering withdrawing from this class, discussing this with me as early as
possible is advised.  Since this class involves a project, the decision to
withdraw must also be discussed with your group.

### Special Needs Information

If you have a documented disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation(s), please contact both me and the office of Disabled Student
Services within the first two weeks of class.

### Diversity Statement

Montana State University considers the diversity of its students, faculty, and
staff to be a strength and critical to its educational mission. MSU expects
every member of the university community to contribute to an inclusive and
respectful culture for all in its classrooms, work environments, and at campus
events.  Dimensions of diversity can include sex, race, age, national origin,
ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and physical ability,
sexual orientation, income, faith and non-faith perspectives, socio-economic
status, political ideology, education, primary language, family status, military
experience, cognitive style, and communication style. The individual
intersection of these experiences and characteristics must be valued in our
community.

If there are aspects of the design, instruction, and/or experiences within this
course that result in barriers to your inclusion or accurate assessment of
achievement, please notify the instructor as soon as possible and/or contact
Disability Services or the Office of Institutional Equity.

### Use of Materials

This syllabus, course lectures and presentations, and any course materials
provided throughout this term are protected by U.S. copyright laws.  Students
enrolled in the course may use them for their own research and educational
purposes.  However, reproducing, selling or otherwise distributing these
materials without written permission of the copyright owner is expressly
prohibited, including providing materials (or solutions) to commercial
platforms such as Chegg or CourseHero.  Doing so may constitute a violation of
U.S. copyright law as well as MSU’s Code of Student Conduct.

### Special Remarks and Policies for the COVID-19 Pandemic

Masks are required in the classroom, at least through 1 October 2021.  The
instructor requests that you wear masks as long as Gallatin county is in a "high
transmission" status. If you need to miss class due to COVID-19 infection or
quarantine (or any other reason), please communicate with the instructor as soon
as possible in order to coordinate a plan for making up the missed classwork.
As a reminder, attendance is required.  If the instructor is unable to make it
to class, either a substitute will be found for those lectures or the class will
be held via Zoom.

## MSU Policies

### Academic Integrity

The integrity of the academic process requires that credit be given where credit
is due. Accordingly, it is academic misconduct to present the ideas or works of
another as one's own work, or to permit another to present one's work without
customary and proper acknowledgment of authorship. Students may collaborate with
other students only as expressly permitted by the instructor. Students are
responsible for the honest completion and representation of their work, the
appropriate citation of sources and the respect and recognition of others'
academic endeavors.

Plagiarism will not be tolerated in this course. According to the Meriam-Webster
dictionary, plagiarism is `the act of using another person's words or ideas
without giving credit to that person.'  Proper credit means describing all
outside resources (conversations, websites, etc.), and explaining the extent to
which the resource was used.  Penalties for plagiarism at MSU include (but are
not limited to) failing the assignment, failing the class, or having your degree
revoked.  This is serious, so do not plagiarize.  Even inadvertent or
unintentional misuse or appropriation of another's work (such as relying heavily
on source material that is not expressly acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. 

By participating in this class, you agree to abide by the Student Code of
Conduct.  This includes the following academic expectations:

- be prompt and regular in attending classes;
- be well-prepared for classes;
- submit required assignments in a timely manner;
- take exams when scheduled, unless rescheduled under 310.01;
- act in a respectful manner toward other students and the instructor and in a
  way that does not detract from the learning experience; and
- make and keep appointments when necessary to meet with the instructor. 


### MSU Drug and Alcohol Policies

Per the Code of Conduct for students, no student may come to class under the
influence of drugs or alcohol, as that would not be`Fostering a healthy, safe
and productive campus and community.`  See [Alcohol and Drug Policies
Website](http://www.montana.edu/deanofstudents/alcoholanddrugs.html) for more
information.  In particular, note:

```
As a federally-funded institution, we must adhere to all federal laws when it
comes to alcohol and drug use or distribution. This holds true for marijuana as
well. Using or distributing marijuana on or off campus is a violation of our
code of conduct even if a student has a medical card or comes from a state in
which marijuana is legal or has been decriminalized.

As noted, the University's alcohol and drug policies apply off campus. Using
drugs and/or alcohol and returning to your residence hall in a disruptive
fashion--either via odor, noise, destruction, etc--can lead to residence life
policy and alcohol or drug policy violations. Remember, not everyone wants to
hear or smell you.
```
